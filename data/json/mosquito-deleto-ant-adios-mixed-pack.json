    "faq": "How often should I apply it?\nApply Mosquito Deleto every 14 days in regions with higher precipitation, or every 28 days for drier areas.\nApply Ant Adios every 2 to 4 weeks as bait is consumed.\nShould I treat my entire lawn?\nRather than covering the entire lawn, designate a \u201cprotected zone\u201d in the area where you spend the most time. Spray this zone regularly.\nHow do I apply it?\nIt's best to apply Ant Adios first and let it get to work for a week before applying Mosquito Deleto repellent. If you use them at the same time, avoid spraying repellent where you laid the ant bait.\nScatter Ant Adios on soil around or near plants in need. Avoid applying over flowering plants when pollinators are present!\nSpray Mosquito Deleto in an up and down motion, working quickly to cover your protected lawn area, trees, mulch, and bushes until all foliage is just fully wet.\nShould I use these products before or after Sunday nutrients?\nYou can apply either one first\u2014the order is totally up to you! Regardless, you\u2019ll want to wait 24 hours between those applications to avoid washing out or diluting either formula.\nWhat's the difference between Mosquito Deleto and Nix Ticks?\nMosquito Deleto is a repellant with a strong lemongrass oil formulation to target mosquitos.\nAnt Adios is bait containing spinosad, a naturally occurring soil-dwelling organism that attacks the ant's nervous system.\nAre there any US states or territories where Mosquito Deleto and Ant Adios are not approved for use?\nMosquito Deleto is not yet approved for use in the following states and territories: DC, ID, IN, MD, ME, MS, MT.\nAnt Adios is approved for use in all states."
