    "faq": "How to apply Fire Ant Fighter\nApply when ants are active, above 60\u00b0F in early morning or late evening. Keep bait dry. Do not water in.\nFor mounds, sprinkle 4 tablespoons around small mounds or 6 tablespoons around large mounds.\nFor prevention, broadcast 1/3 to 2/3 cup per 1,000 sq ft.\nWhen should I reapply Fire Ant Fighter?\nReapply as needed for heavy infestations. In warmer months, broadcast every other month to help prevent new mounds.\nCan I use Fire Ant Fighter with other Sunday products?\nSure can. Apply any liquid lawn or repellent products first and let them dry completely. Then place bait. Keep bait dry. If bait gets wet, reapply.\nIs Fire Ant Fighter safe for kids and pets?\nThis is still a pesticide, so use it as directed. Place bait carefully and keep children and pets away from treated mounds and baited areas until the bait is collected by ants or removed as directed on the label."
