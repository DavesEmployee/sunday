    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nWhy combine weed control, seeding, and feeding?\nThis system creates a healthier lawn by addressing the three most important aspects of lawn care simultaneously: removing weeds eliminates competition, adding seed fills in bare spots, and fertilizing provides essential nutrients for stronger growth.\nWhen is the best time to apply this kit?\nApply when temperatures are consistently between 55-75\u00b0F, typically in spring or fall. Apply weed control when weeds are actively growing. Avoid applying if rain is expected within three hours.\nCan I use this kit on any lawn?\nThis kit is designed for cool-season grass types found in northern and transition zones. It works best on established lawns that need renovation.\nIs this product safe for kids and pets?\nYes. It's safe to return to the lawn after weed control and seeded areas have dried. However, for optimal results, especially for seed germination, limit traffic on newly seeded areas until grass is established.\nHow soon will I see results?\nYou'll begin seeing results in 8-21 days, depending on moisture and temperature conditions. New grass will continue to fill in and thicken over the following weeks.\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all northern states."
