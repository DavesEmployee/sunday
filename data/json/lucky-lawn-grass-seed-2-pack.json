    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nWhat is microclover grass seed?\nLucky Lawn consists of tall and fine fescue and 5% microclover. Clover establishes and spreads quickly in places where your grass has trouble growing. It mixes well with most cool-season grasses, especially fescues and Kentucky bluegrass. Bonus? Clover is a nitrogen fixer, meaning it can organically convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form readily available to plants.\nWhen to plant microclover and fescue seed?\nThe optimal time to seed this mix is during spring and fall when temperatures consistently range between 55 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. You can also plant this mix in winter months when temperatures consistently fall below 40 degrees F.\nHow long does micro clover and fescue grass seed take to grow?\nExpect germination between 3-12 days.\nHow to plant microclover and fescue seed\nApply at the correct rate.\nFor overseeding, use 2 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft.; for starting a new lawn from scratch, use 5 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft. For patching, cover the area lightly with seed and topdress with compost or a light layer of soil if desired.\nStart at the lowest setting and apply uniformly.\nFor hand or drop spreader applications, no matter the spreader type, always begin at the lowest setting. Increase the spreader setting if the seed is getting stuck or not easily distributed. Walk at a consistent pace across the lawn to distribute seed uniformly. Check after application for uniformity and reapply in areas where coverage is light.\nWater the seed to germination.\nKeep the seed moist, not oversaturated, until the grass seed germinates\u2014depending on the grass type, this can be 1-3 weeks. Avoid letting new or germinating seeds dry out to ensure successful seeding.\nSunday Grass Seed Instructions\nStep-by-step instructions on how to seed Sunday's premium cool-season grass seed for a thicker, climate-resilient, and weed-free lawn.\nRead article"
