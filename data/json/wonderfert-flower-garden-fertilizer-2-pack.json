    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Yard Advisors:\nHow does liquid flower food enhance bloom quality and quantity?\nWith its high PK content and seaweed extract, it promotes vigorous root and flower development.\nIts unique seaweed extract formula and high PK content cater specifically to flowering plants.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between WonderFert Flower and other liquid flower garden fertilizers?\nWhen it comes to flower food, there are many options to choose from. We formulated ours to provide higher levels of phosphorus and potassium to boost blooms and added seaweed for greater resilience to growing season stressors. Beyond a seaweed-powered formulation, WonderFert Flower offers dual application via hose and watering can, covers more square footage (up to 500 sq. ft.), and offers less frequent applications (every 4-6 weeks).\nHow does seaweed extract support flowers?\nSeaweed extract aids flowers by reducing stress and enhancing yield. Plus, its natural nutrients support healthy development and resilience in flowering plants.\nIs WonderFert Flower suitable for all types of flowering plants?\nIt's ideal for various flowering plants, including roses, annuals and perennials, container plants, and fruiting plants. It may not be suitable for flowering plants that aren\u2019t well-suited for or do not require fertilization.\nHow to use with other Sunday products?\nIf using other Sunday products, let liquid fertilizers dry completely before applying anything else to your garden. For best results, use our liquid garden fertilizer in combination with Sunday\u2019s dry organic fertilizer, Soil Boost, and weed control. This will help you fertilize plants properly, reduce weeds, and introduce nutrients back to your soil."
