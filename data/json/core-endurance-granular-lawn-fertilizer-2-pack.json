    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow is Sunday granular fertilizer different from traditional fertilizers?\nMost granular fertilizers stop at nutrition. Sunday granulated are the complete care package. Our formulas combine slow-release nutrients with soil-building ingredients and specialized formulations (with surfactant or kelp) that help your lawn stay resilient during summer heatwaves.\nWhat grasses can I apply granular fertilizer on?\nSunday\u2019s granular fertilizer works for all residential turfgrasses. We don\u2019t recommend applying to centipedegrass more than twice per year, and it\u2019s not formulated for golf course grasses like colonial bentgrass or creeping bentgrass.\nWhen to water after granular fertilizer\nWatering in granular fertilizer immediately after application helps ensure the nutrients reach the soil and the grass\u2019s root zone, avoiding any potential lawn burn. Plus, it reduces granule movement.\nCan I use granular fertilizer with liquid lawn fertilizer?\nWe don\u2019t recommend using granular fertilizer alongside other fertilizers, including Sunday liquid fertilizers. Wait 6 weeks after applying granular fertilizer before applying liquid lawn fertilizer for best results.\nHow much lawn fertilizer will I need?\nEach bag covers 4,000 sq. ft. Application based on yard size:\n1,000\u20132,000 sq. ft.: 1/2 bag\n2,000\u20134,000 sq. ft.: 1 bag\n4,000\u20136,000 sq. ft.: 1 \u00bd bags\n6,000-8,000 sq. ft.: 2 bags\n8,000-10,000 sq. ft.: 2 \u00bd bags\n10,000-12,000 sq. ft.: 3 bags\nWhen is it safe for people and pets to go on my lawn after applying?\nOur ingredients break down quickly and don\u2019t persist in the environment. Once the product is watered in and your lawn dries, it\u2019s safe for people and pets to resume activities!\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all states."
