    "faq": "How does it work?\nSun & Shade Seed + Feed delivers your lawn fertilizer, seed, and soil conditioner in one application. Our 9-0-2 blend of fertilizer is specially formulated to enhance existing lawns with immediate and sustained growth for up to 6 weeks. Premium grass varieties help build dense turf that can outcompete weeds and withstand drought and disease. Plus, nutrient-rich ingredients like limestone, gypsum, and dried poultry litter have soil-amending properties and help build healthier soils.\nHow many square feet does one bag cover?\nEach bag covers up to 1,500 sq. ft. Keep in mind that it\u2019s not designed for planting a yard from scratch or filling in large bare patches, but instead should be used to thicken up an existing lawn.\nWhich climates can use this product?\nOur Sun + Shade formula contains seed cultivars designed to thrive in northern and transitional climates. It's best in yards that have full sun to medium shade.\nHow do I apply it? How often?\nApply using a hand spreader or broadcast spreader at a rate of 10 pounds /1,500 square feet. You can apply every 6 weeks during the growing season, up to four times per year.\nWhen is the best time to apply Sun & Shade Seed + Feed?\nWe recommend applying in the morning or evening. This ensures you\u2019re applying at the least stressful time of day and are able to water fertilizer and seed efficiently.\nShould I treat my entire lawn?\nYes. For best results, apply across your entire lawn to ensure uniform application.\nCan I use this if I\u2019m already growing another grass type?\nAs long as you have a cool-season lawn, you can use across your existing lawn. We don't recommend using on warm-season lawns.\nHow long will it take to germinate or see results?\nYou should begin to see deeper greening and germination in 8-21 days, so long as the product is applied correctly and watered to germination properly. We recommend keeping the soil moist but not saturated until new grass reaches about 2 inches in height, and then returning to deep and infrequent watering practices.\nWhat impact does weather play on growth/yield?\nWeather can hinder seed germination success if extreme weather, like a late freeze or heat wave, set in. We recommend only applying in stretches of weeks where the ideal temperature for cool-season seed germination is maintained (60-75 degrees F).\nWhat's in it?\nThis blend includes four types of grasses, including tall fescue, fine fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, and perennial ryegrass.\nCan I use this if I\u2019m already using another fertilizer product?\nYou only need to wait two weeks between the applications of Sun & Shade Seed + Feed and Sunday liquid nutrients. We don't recommend utilizing both Seed + Feed with other fertilizers at the same time. Applying two types of fertilizer together can cause overfertilization or damage to actively growing grass. If you are switching between Seed + Feed and other Sunday fertilizers, wait at least 6 weeks between applications.\nWhat is the difference between Sun & Shade Seed + Feed and Bare Repair?\nSun & Shade Seed + Feed is only recommended for overseeding. Bare Repair is ideal for patching bare or other thin areas in the lawn. Seed + Feed products are made of fertilizer, soil conditioner, and grass seed\u2014and recommended for overseeding across existing lawns, not new lawns or bare soils. Bare Repair is a combination of seed, fertilizer, and mulch, and is ideal for patching bare soil or other thin areas in the lawn.\nSafe re-entry time for pets? For people?\nPets and humans can use areas as soon as products are watered in.\nAre there any US states or territories where this product is not approved for use?\nSun & Shade is approved for use and distribution in all states. Special registrations for CA, FL, and PA."
