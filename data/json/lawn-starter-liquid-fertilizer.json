Lawn Starter provides supplemental phosphorus to nourish the new seedlings and ensure successful establishment.\nWhy is my soil deficient in phosphorus?\nPhosphorus can deplete in soils over time or be missing from new lawns with new topsoil. Symptoms of phosphorus deficiency include purple leaves or thinning turfgrass.\nHow to apply boosts alongside other Sunday fertilizers\nBoosts with nutrients can be used in combination with your Sunday Lawn Plans or other fertilizers. For best results, follow the instructions below.\nFor liquid fertilizer: First, apply the boost pouch, then wait 7 to 10 days before applying the liquid fertilizer.\nFor granular: Apply boost pouch, wait 4-6 weeks, then apply granular fertilizer.\nThis product isn't for routine maintenance. It's designed for first-year lawns or those with phosphorus-deficient soils.\nWhen is it safe for people and pets to go on my lawn after applying?\nOur ingredients break down quickly and don\u2019t persist in the environment. After our products dry, you can get back to using your lawn!\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all states. It is only approved for use on newly seeded or sodded lawns or when a soil test shows a phosphorus deficiency. In Maryland, it can only be used on New or Starter lawns only."
