It\u2019s able to resist drought, tolerate shade, and stand up to high traffic, making it perfect for active outdoor spaces.\nWhen to plant fescue grass seed?\nThe optimal time to seed this mix is during spring and fall when temperatures consistently range between 55 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. You can also seed this mix in winter months when temperatures consistently fall below 40 degrees F.\nHow long does fescue grass seed take to grow?\nExpect germination between 6-12 days.\nHow to plant fescue grass seed?\nApply at the correct rate.\nFor overseeding, use 2 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft.; for starting a new lawn from scratch, use 8 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft. For patching, cover the area lightly with seed and topdress with compost or a light layer of soil if desired.\nStart at the lowest setting and apply uniformly.\nFor hand or drop spreader applications, no matter the spreader type, always begin at the lowest setting. Increase the spreader setting if the seed is getting stuck or not easily distributed. Walk at a consistent pace across the lawn to distribute seed uniformly. Check after application for uniformity and reapply in areas where coverage is light.\nWater the seed to germination.\nKeep seed moist, not oversaturated, until grass seed germinates - depending on grass type this can be 1-3 weeks. Avoid letting new or germinating seeds dry out to ensure successful seeding.\nSunday Grass Seed Instructions\nStep-by-step instructions on how to seed Sunday's premium cool-season grass seed for a thicker, climate-resilient, and weed-free lawn.\nRead article"
