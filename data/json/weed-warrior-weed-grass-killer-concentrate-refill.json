    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow does weed and grass killer work?\nWeed Warrior is a powerful herbicidal soap made from fatty acids. It eats away at the waxy coating that protects most green leafy growth from the elements, causing rapid desiccation and plant death.\nWhat vegetation does Weed Warrior control?\nEffective against bluegrass, chickweed, crabgrass, corn spurry, dandelion, groundsel, lambsquarters, mouse-eared chickweed, mustards, plantain, redroot pigweed, round leaved mallow, sheep sorrel, shepherd's-purse, stinkweed, thistle, moss, algae, and lichens.\nDo I need the Weed Warrior Starter Pack to use this product?\nYes, this is a refill concentrate only. You'll need the sprayer and pouch that come with the Weed Warrior Starter Pack or Starter 2-Pack to apply this product.\nCan I use weed and grass killer on my lawn?\nWeed Warrior is non-selective, meaning it will kill any vegetation it contacts - including grass. We recommend using it in gardens, sidewalks, mulch and other hardscapes rather than within your lawn. If you use Weed Warrior within your lawn, repair it with Sunday Grass Seed or Bare Repair (https://www.getsunday.com/shop/category/lawn-care/grass-seed).\nHow long does concentrate last?\nConcentrates have a shelf life of approximately 2 years. After the initial mixing, mix well again if it sits for 30+ days.\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all states."
