Lawn Aid is designed to prepare your lawn for heat stress and needs time to be absorbed before your lawn is exposed to extreme summer heat.\nCan I apply more than once a season?\nYes!

Lawn Aid can be used in combination with your custom lawn plan. No waiting period is required but we recommend waiting until the first application is dry.

After our products dry, you can get back to playing outside right away!\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all states."
