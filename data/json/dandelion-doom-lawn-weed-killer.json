    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow does this lawn-safe weed killer work?\nGrass and weeds absorb iron differently. Weeds quickly take in too much iron, which becomes toxic and kills them. Grass absorbs iron more slowly and can tolerate higher amounts. This difference allows us to target weeds while giving your lawn a healthy, deeper green color.\nWhat's the difference between ready-to-use Dandelion Doom and the concentrate version?\nThis is a ready-to-use formula in convenient spray bottles - no mixing required. It's perfect for spot-treating individual weeds or small areas. The concentrate version is more economical for treating larger areas but requires mixing with water and using a sprayer system.\nWhat weeds does Dandelion Doom control?\nDandelion Doom is effective on broadleaf weeds like black medic*, broadleaf plantain, bull thistle, Canada thistle*, common chickweed*, creeping buttercup, creeping charlie/ground ivy*, dandelion, dovefoot geranium*, English daisy*, false dandelion, healall*, moss, liverworts*, algae* and lichens*, narrow-leaved plantain*, oxalis, Persian Speedwell, prostrate knotweed*, shepherd\u2019s-purse*, silverweed cinquefoil*, slender speedwell*, white clover, wild chamomile*.\nIt can also control or suppress diseases such as but not limited to*: Dollar Spot, Rust or Snow Mold.\n*Not approved for this use in California. Please see California label for approved use.\nDoes Dandelion Doom stain?\nYes, it can cause staining due to high iron content. Avoid using on sidewalks, concrete, or other hard surfaces. If you accidentally spill, immediately spray and dilute the area with water. For best results, apply on calm days to prevent overspray.\nHow to use Dandelion Doom with other Sunday products?\nIdeally, apply weed control before seeding, fertilizing, or applying pest control. Allow to dry completely before applying other liquid products or watering your lawn. For best results with Sunday grass seed, wait one day after applying Dandelion Doom before seeding.\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all states."
