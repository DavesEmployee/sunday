    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow does this organic weed killer work?\nWeed Warrior is a powerful herbicidal soap made from fatty acids. It eats away at the waxy coating that protects most green leafy growth from the elements, causing rapid desiccation and plant death.\nWhat's the difference between this and the concentrate version?\nThis is a ready-to-use formula in convenient spray bottles - no mixing required. It's perfect for spot-treating individual weeds or small areas. The concentrate version is more economical for treating larger areas but requires mixing with water and using a sprayer system.\nCan I use this on my lawn?\nIt depends. Weed Warrior is non-selective, meaning it will kill any vegetation it contacts - including grass. We recommend using it in flower beds, patios, sidewalks, and mulched areas. If you need to control weeds in your lawn, use Weed Warrior carefully and patch any affected grass as needed. Or use Dandelion Doom which is formulated to kill weeds without harming grass!\nWhat vegetation does Weed Warrior control?\nEffective against bluegrass, chickweed, crabgrass, corn spurry, dandelion, groundsel, lambsquarters, mouse-eared chickweed, mustards, plantain, redroot pigweed, round leaved mallow, sheep sorrel, shepherd's-purse, stinkweed, thistle, moss, algae, and lichens.\nWhen will I see results?\nFully drenched weeds will dry up in as little as 20 minutes or up to 24 hours, depending on the size and maturity of the plant you are spraying.\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all states."
