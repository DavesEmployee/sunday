    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nWhat does sulfur do for my lawn?\nSulfur, like in our Super S blend, enhances nutrient uptake in your soil and addresses deficiencies, improving overall lawn health. The benefits range from richer color and increased stress resistance to consistent, robust growth.\nWhy is my soil deficient in sulfur?\nSandy or well-drained soils can lose sulfur due to leaching, cleaner air regulations result in less sulfur deposits from rain, and removing grass clippings can deplete sulfur. Together, these factors can lead to a sulfur-deficient lawn.\nHow are Sunday premium liquid fertilizers different?\nSunday's premium liquid fertilizers, once exclusive to custom lawn plans, are highly concentrated with nutrients, soil amendments, and specialty ingredients for effective and fast results.\nHow to apply alongside other Sunday fertilizers\nBoosts can be used in combination with your Sunday Lawn Plans or other fertilizers. For best results, follow the instructions below.\nFor liquid fertilizer: First, apply the boost pouch, then wait 7 to 10 days before applying the liquid fertilizer.\nFor granular: Apply boost pouch, wait 4-6 weeks, then apply granular fertilizer.\nWhen is it safe for people and pets to go on my lawn after applying?\nOur ingredients break down quickly and don\u2019t persist in the environment. After our products dry, you can get back to using your lawn!\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nSuper S is restricted in Idaho & Oregon."
