    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Yard Advisors:\nWhat is \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 used for?\n\u2018grubGONE!\u2019 is a seasonal application that can be used to effectively treat grub infestations within a yard - including lawns, landscaping, garden beds and plant containers.\nWhat does it control?\nWhen applied at label rates, it is active against annual white grubs of the annual bluegrass weevil, Asiatic garden beetle, European chafer, green June beetle, Japanese beetle, oriental beetle, southern masked chafer, and black turfgrass ataenius.\nHow does it work?\n\u2018grubGONE!\u2019 contains Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. galleriae, a bacterial strain that when ingested by white grubs effectively kills the organism.\nHow do I apply grub control?\nApply \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 with a handheld spreader or a gloved hand to the areas where grubs are present. If using a hand spreader, start your spreader on the lowest setting first and slowly increase it to the right setting for your spreader and the size of the granules.\nHow much do I apply?\nFor lawns or landscapes: Apply between 2 lb 5 oz to 3 lb 7 oz of grubGONE!\u00ae G per 1,000 sq ft of turf grass, or ornamental plants.\nFor container plants: Measure the soil surface area, and apply grubGONE!\u00ae G at a proportional rate.\nHow often should I apply it?\n\u2018grubGONE!\u2019 can be applied in Spring, Summer, and/or Fall seasons as needed. Do not apply more than once in a 7-day period and only apply as directed on the label.\nHow effective is \u2018grubGONE!\u2019? When will I see results?\nWhen applied at appropriate times (between spring and fall), \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 has been shown to have an efficacy rate of over 80%.\nThe level of efficacy will depend on larval size, grub species, and the amount or dose of active ingredient consumed. Allow a least a week to determine the efficacy of the application.\nShould I treat my entire lawn?\nWe recommend only treating areas of your lawn where grubs are present. These tend to be areas of the lawn where you have already detected grubs or have signs of grub damage.\nHow to check for grubs?\nUse a shovel or trowel to inspect the soil in damaged areas from the top to at least 2\u201d depth. Grubs are visible to the naked eye and easy to spot as small, white larvae.\nCan I use \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 with my Custom Yard Plan?\nYes! \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 does not contain fertilizer and is appropriate to use in conjunction with your Custom Yard Plan. For best results, apply Sunday fertilizer first, allow 24 hours for the product to dry, then apply \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 and lightly water in the application.\nAny reentry time for pets? Humans?\nPets and humans can reenter the application area as long as the product has been watered into the soil. For added safety, fence off application areas to avoid product being tracked by shoes or paws.\nDoes \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 harm beneficial insects?\nWhen applied as directed, \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 effectively targets grubs of targeted insects (see above). However, the product should not be applied within 300 feet of any threatened or endangered butterflies, moths, or beetles.\nDoes \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 harm any other beneficial organisms?\nWe do not recommend applying \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 near water bodies, or areas where surface water is located to avoid contamination of water or contact with aquatic/marine organisms.\nAre there any US states or territories where \u2018grubGONE!\u2019 is not approved for use?\nAK, LA, NV, NM, UT."
