    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Yard Advisors:\nHow does Weed & Green work?\nGrass and weeds absorb iron differently. Weeds quickly take in too much iron, which becomes toxic and kills them. Grass absorbs iron more slowly and can tolerate higher amounts. This difference allows us to target weeds effectively and safely while giving your lawn a healthy, deeper green color.\nWhat weeds can I use Weed & Green on?\nWeed & Green can be used as a pre-emergent for crabgrass and broadleaf weeds, and as post-emergent for broadleaf weeds, moss, algae, and lichen. It will help to suppress lawn diseases* including dollar spot, rust and snow mold.\nWhile it\u2019s effective as a pre-emergent on crabgrass, it won\u2019t control existing crabgrass.\nWill this preemergent cause discoloration to dormant lawns?\nWeed and Green can be applied before or after weeds begin to emerge. This might mean you\u2019re applying to a dormant lawn - or grass that\u2019s not yet green and actively growing. If your lawn is dormant, Weed & Green may cause temporary discoloration of grass. But don't worry! Any grayish or brown color is temporary, and grass will return to its natural green as it grows.\nWhat\u2019s pre-emergent herbicide? What\u2019s post-emergent herbicide?\nA pre-emergent weed killer is designed to prevent weeds from sprouting above ground and works by targeting weeds as they germinate underground.\nA post-emergent weed control controls weeds and other plants after they emerge from the soil.\nIs there a difference between pre-emergent and post-emergent applications for Weed & Green?\nYes! Temperature and application frequency matter.\nFor pre-emergent control: Apply when soil temps reach 50-55 degrees F, and reapply 3-6 weeks later up to 2 times per year in the same area.\nFor post-emergent control: Apply anytime from spring through fall, and repeat treatment every 3-4 weeks up to 4 times per year in the same area."
