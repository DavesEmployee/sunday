    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Yard Advisors:\nWhat does each product in this pre-emergent and post-emergent weed kit control?\nWeed & Green acts as both a pre-emergent weed preventer and post-emergent weed killer, stopping crabgrass and broadleaf weeds before they emerge while controlling existing weeds. Dandelion Doom provides targeted post-emergent control for common lawn weeds like dandelions, clover, chickweed, thistle, and creeping charlie without harming your grass.\nWhen should I apply each lawn weed control product?\nApply Weed & Green as prevention, then spot-treat breakthrough weeds with Dandelion Doom.\nApply Weed & Green pre-emergent in early spring (average temps ~50-55\u00b0F) for crabgrass prevention, or anytime spring through fall as a post-emergent broadleaf weed control. Use Dandelion Doom selective weed killer anytime you spot weeds that need targeted treatment in established lawns.\nWhy does Sunday weed control kit include different sprayers?\nEach sprayer is optimized for its specific weed control application - Weed & Green's hose-end sprayer provides broad lawn coverage for pre-emergent and post-emergent treatment, while Dandelion Doom's wand sprayer delivers precise spot treatment for stubborn lawn weeds.\nWill Sunday lawn weed control products harm my grass?\nNot these formulas! Both are iron-based and lawn-safe weed killers.\nWeed and Green can be applied before weeds begin to emerge, even to dormant lawns that aren't yet green and growing. The iron formula of Weed & Green may cause temporary discoloration of grass. But don't worry! Any grayish color is temporary, and grass will return to its natural green as it grows. Overall, these products help your lawn by eliminating weeds while providing iron that supports greener, healthier grass.\nAny weed killer application tips or precautions?\nAvoid spraying iron-based weed control on hardscapes as it may stain concrete or pavers. Apply when no rain is expected for 24 hours for maximum effectiveness, and let applications dry completely before allowing foot traffic on the treated lawn areas.\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nApproved in all states, except CA (pending)."
