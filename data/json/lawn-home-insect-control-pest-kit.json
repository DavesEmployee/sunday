    "faq": "Where can I use this?\nThe Lawn & Home Barrier Pest Kit is appropriate for all typical turfgrass lawns, as well as homes experiencing extensive pest issues from crawling and flying near the home structure.\nHow does it work?\nLawn Vitality boosts initial grass growth and provides deep greening from nitrogen and iron. Plus it contains molasses to help boost soil life.\nBug Doom\u2019s active ingredients pyrethrin and canola oil act on contact to affect the nervous system (pyrethrins) and respiratory system (canola oil) of pests.\nWhat does it control?\nTargeted insects include ants (excluding fire ants, harvester ants, Pharaoh ants, and carpenter ants), bed bugs, beetles, boxelder bugs, carpet beetles, caterpillars, centipedes, clothes moths, American cockroaches, crickets, darkling beetles, dermestids, earwigs, Elm leaf beetles, firebrats, hide beetles, house flies, kudzu bugs, leather beetles, non-biting midges, millipedes, moths, multicolored Asian lady beetles, pantry pests, pillbugs, silverfish, sowbugs, spiders (excluding black widow, brown recluse, and hobo spiders), and stink bugs (including brown marmorated stink bugs).\nIn what order should I use products?\nIdeally, apply Lawn Vitality first. Using your sprayer attachment and hose, uniformly apply the nutrients across your lawn. If the lawn is adjacent to the home, allow liquid lawn nutrients to dry. Once dry, apply Bug Doom Home Insect Control as directed to the outdoor perimeter and Bug Doom Indoor Spray to entry points and pest populations inside the home. Going forward, reapply pest control products as needed and use your Let\u2019s Get Growing guide to implement better yard care practices.\nWhen is the best time to apply?\nThroughout the growing season, meaning spring through fall, to manage pests during peak activity and to maintain lawns during the growing season. Indoor pest control can be applied year-round as needed.\nBest application tips\nApply Lawn Vitality to actively growing lawns, and ensure your lawn is sufficiently hydrated before application.\nDo not apply products when rain is expected in 3 hours.\nApply pest control according to the label.\nIf pest bait accidentally gets wet, reapply the product.\nNatural pest prevention, or integrated pest management (IPM), is the key to managing pests effectively."
