    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nWhat is fine fescue?\nFine fescue is a fine-textured grass seed that forms a deep green lawn. It is highly tolerant of shade, can resist stress when established, and stands up to high traffic, making it perfect for active, low-light outdoor spaces.\nCan I plant this throughout my lawn if it\u2019s not all shaded?\nYes! This blend contains fine fescue, which thrives in full sun and shade. It\u2019s OK if it\u2019s not the same grass type as the rest of your lawn because diversity creates strength and resilience against insects and disease.\nWhen to plant fescue grass seed?\nThe optimal time to seed this mix is during spring and fall when temperatures consistently range between 55 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. You can also seed this mix in winter months when temperatures consistently fall below 40 degrees F.\nHow long does fescue grass seed take to grow?\nExpect germination between 6-12 days.\nHow to plant fescue grass seed\nApply at the correct rate.\nFor overseeding, use 2 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft.; for starting a new lawn from scratch, use 5 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft. For patching, cover the area lightly with seed and topdress with compost or a light layer of soil if desired.\nStart at the lowest setting and apply uniformly.\nFor hand or drop spreader applications, no matter the spreader type, always begin at the lowest setting. Increase the spreader setting if the seed is getting stuck or not easily distributed. Walk at a consistent pace across the lawn to distribute seed uniformly. Check after application for uniformity and reapply in areas where coverage is light.\nWater the seed to germination.\nKeep the seed moist, not oversaturated, until the grass seed germinates\u2014depending on the grass type, this can be 1-3 weeks. Avoid letting new or germinating seeds dry out to ensure successful seeding."
