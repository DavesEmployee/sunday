    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow does lawn-safe weed killer work?\nGrass and weeds absorb iron differently. Weeds quickly take in too much iron, which becomes toxic and kills them. Grass absorbs iron more slowly and can tolerate higher amounts. This difference allows us to target weeds while giving your lawn a healthy, deeper green color.\nHow to use Dandelion Doom with other Sunday products?\nYou can apply weed killer, like Dandelion Doom, before or after lawn fertilizer. Allow weed control products to dry completely before applying any other Sunday liquid products or watering your lawn\u2013the longer the plant absorbs the weed control, the more effective the application.\nWhen will I see results?\nFully drenched weeds will dry up in as little as 20 minutes or up to 24 hours, depending on the size and maturity of the plant you are spraying.\nWhat weeds does Dandelion Doom control?\nDandelion Doom is effective on broadleaf weeds like black medic*, broadleaf plantain, bull thistle, Canada thistle*, common chickweed*, creeping buttercup, creeping charlie/ground ivy*, dandelion, dovefoot geranium*, English daisy*, false dandelion, healall*, moss, liverworts*, algae* and lichens*, narrow-leaved plantain*, oxalis, Persian Speedwell, prostrate knotweed*, shepherd\u2019s-purse*, silverweed cinquefoil*, slender speedwell*, white clover, wild chamomile*.\nIt can also control or suppress diseases such as but not limited to*: Dollar Spot, Rust or Snow Mold.\n*Not approved for this use in California.
