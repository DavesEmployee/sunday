  "description": "A pet spot solution that\u2019s better for paws and planet\n\nLove pets? And lawns? And pets on lawns? We do too! But we don\u2019t love the inevitable urine spots. Our liquid lawn repair is formulated with hard-working soil remediation ingredients like humic acid, seaweed, and iron to wash away contaminants and revive damaged areas. Use it as a spot treatment or preventively!",

    "faq": "How does Pet Patch work?\nPet Patch contains humic acid, seaweed, and surfactant to heal pesky pet spots. The humic acid is a soil conditioner, while seaweed promotes resilience. The surfactant helps soil hold moisture, which spurs grass regrowth and distributes urine contaminants away from roots in the soil.\nI sprayed Pet Patch, but new grass hasn\u2019t filled in yet. What\u2019s going on?\nWhile Pet Patch repairs and conditions soil to become hospitable for grass regrowth, it does not contain grass seed or nitrogen. Certain grasses fill in quicker than others, but for slow-filling grasses we recommend using Pet Patch alongside a seeding routine.\nHow much coverage should I expect from one pouch?\nAs a treatment, it can repair approximately 50 large pet spots. Or it can be used proactively across a large area of lawn (up to 2,500 sq. ft.) to increase moisture retention, making the lawn less likely to develop pet spots in the first place.\nCan Pet Patch be used alongside my Sunday nutrient applications?\nYes! Pet Patch does not interfere with Sunday nutrient application timing. As with all of our liquid products, we do recommend a drying period in between applications.\nShould I use Pet Patch before or after Sunday nutrients?\nYou can apply either Pet Patch or your nutrients first\u2014it\u2019s up to you! However, you\u2019ll want to wait 24 hours in between those applications to avoid washing out the nutrients or diluting them."
