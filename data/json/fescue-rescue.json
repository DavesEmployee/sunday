    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nWhat is tall fescue?\nTall fescue is a hardy grass seed variety that forms a dense, green lawn. It\u2019s able to resist drought, tolerate shade, and stand up to high traffic, making it perfect for active outdoor spaces.\nWhen to plant fescue grass seed?\nThe optimal time to seed this mix is during spring and fall when temperatures consistently range between 55 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. You can also seed this mix in winter months when temperatures hold consistently below 40 degrees F.\nHow long does fescue grass seed take to grow?\nExpect germination between 6-12 days.\nHow to plant fescue grass seed?\nApply at the correct rate. For overseeding, use 5 lbs. per 2,500 sq. ft., for starting a new lawn from scratch use 8 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft. For patching, cover the area lightly with seed and topdress with compost or a light layer of soil if desired.\nStart at the lowest setting and apply uniformly. For hand or drop spreader applications, no matter the spreader type, always begin at the lowest setting. Increase the spreader setting if the seed is getting stuck or not easily distributed. Walk at a consistent pace across the lawn to uniformly distribute seed. Check after application for uniformity and reapply in areas where coverage is light.\nWater the seed to germination. Keep seed moist, not oversaturated, until grass seed germinates - depending on grass type this can be 1-3 weeks. Avoid letting new or germinating seeds dry out to ensure successful seeding.\nSunday Grass Seed Instructions\nStep-by-step instructions on how to seed Sunday's premium cool-season grass seed for a thicker, climate-resilient, and weed-free lawn.\nRead article"
