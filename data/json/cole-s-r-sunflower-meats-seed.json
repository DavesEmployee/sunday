    "faq": "What birds will enjoy this feed?\nAttracts all sunflower-loving birds including bluebirds, chickadees, cardinals, Pyrrhuloxia, titmice, finches, woodpeckers, wrens, buntings, grosbeaks, towhees, nuthatches, song sparrows, and doves.\nWhen is the best time to feed wild birds?\nAnytime is a good time to feed birds! However, it is really helpful to supplement our feathered backyard friends with bird seed during migration and winter seasons. This is when they are expending lots of energy traveling long distances, working to retain heat and there may be additional food scarcity.\nWhat is the best feeder to use with this seed?\nAny type of seed feeder, but particularly tube feeders, chalet or hopper feeders, and platform feeders.\nHow often do I need to refill a bird feeder with wild bird seed?\nAs often as you need or desire. However, we recommend checking your feeder every week.\nHow do I fill and mix seeds for a feeder?\nUse this seed as a single premium seed or mix seeds to create a custom mix. Fill your bird feeder so it can close properly and refill biweekly to weekly (as needed). Clean up spills when filling feeders or underneath feeders as needed.\nWhere is the best placement for a bird feeder in my yard?\nInstall at least 10-12 ft from home structure, windows, or potential collisions. Consider squirrel deterrents like squirrel baffles, especially if the feeder is attached or located in a tree.\nWhere should I store this bird seed?\nWe recommend storing the bird seed in a closed container within a dry, cool location. This storage will avoid unwanted pests and issues with seed spoiling due to moisture.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to attract birds to my backyard?\nBirds may not show up immediately after placing seed, feeders, or houses in your yard. They need the right habitat to feel safe and avoid conflicts with potential predators\u2014so adding plants to your backyard that offer perching, shelter, nesting, or foraging habitat will encourage birds to use feeders and houses. Adding some sort of water feature\u2014especially moving water\u2014will encourage birds to find your backyard too.\nAre there any US states or territories where [product] is not approved for use?\nHI"
