    "faq": "In what order should I use the products?\nApply weed control in the lawn first. Assemble the Dandelion Doom herbicide starter kit (pouch, concentrate, wand), then spot treat small weeds and dense patches in the lawn. Fully drench leaves and allow it to dry completely for best results. Next, apply Weed Warrior. Spot treat remaining smaller weeds and patches of weeds with Weed Warrior across mulched areas, flower beds, near patios, along sidewalks. If using in lawn, use caution as it can harm desirable grasses too! Once weed control has dried, apply Iron Boost. Apply uniformly across the lawn and fully drench grass blades for best results. Let the fertilizer dry before doing anything else to the lawn. After 4-6 weeks, apply Texas Green using the same method. Continue to reapply Dandelion Doom every 3-4 weeks, and Weed Warrior every 2-3 weeks as needed until weeds are no longer actively growing.\nHow should I use the fertilizer pouches in my kit if my lawn is less than 5,000 sq. ft.?\nIron Boost and Texas Green cover up to 5,000 sq. ft. 500-1,000 sq. ft.: Apply 1/4 of a pouch (4 uses) 1,000-2,000 sq. ft.: Apply 1/2 of a pouch (2 uses) 2,000-5,000 sq. ft.: Apply a full pouch Wait one week between applications if not applying a full pouch.\nWhat should I do if I apply the products in the wrong order?\nIf fertilizer is applied before applying weed control, that\u2019s okay! Just be sure to apply Dandelion Doom and Weed Warrior as soon as possible after fertilizer. If you applied fertilizer in the opposite order, that's okay too. Just wait 4-6 weeks in between applications.\nCan I use this kit alongside my Sunday lawn plan or other products?\nAbsolutely, this kit is designed to complement Sunday lawn and garden products. Allow dry time between liquid product applications for best results.\nAre there any US states where the kit is not approved for use?\nThis kit is only approved for use in Texas."
