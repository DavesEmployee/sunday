    "faq": "In what order should I use products?\nTackle your weeds first with Dandelion Doom. In general, you should avoid applying nutrients to untreated weeds as this may boost their growth. Note: When switching to Sunday from traditional herbicides, you may require a few applications to kill weeds entirely. After weeds are treated, wait at least 24 hours then apply your Sunday nutrients. Apply Water Focus first and then apply Lawn Aid two weeks later for best results.\nWhat do I need to know when applying lawn nutrients?\nOnly apply to actively growing grass and ensure your lawn is sufficiently hydrated before application. Do not apply when heavy rain is expected.These pouches can be used in combination with your Smart Lawn plan. We recommend waiting 2 to 4 weeks between nutrient applications for best results.\nWhen is it safe for people and pets to go on my lawn after applying?\nOur ingredients break down quickly and get to work on your grass and soil. After our products dry, you can get back to playing outside right away!\nWhere can I apply this product?\nLiquid nutrients are appropriate for all of the most commonly grown residential turfgrasses. It\u2019s not formulated for golf course favorites such as colonial bentgrass and creeping bentgrass.\nWhen is the best time to apply Dandelion Doom?\nWait until temps are between 50 and 85 degrees, then spray dry plants from a close distance until drenched. Wait 20-30 minutes, then pull and dispose of remains. Avoid applying if you\u2019re expecting rain within 3 hours. Repeat every 2-3 weeks to control new growth.\nCan I use it on my lawn?\nYes! Dandelion Doom is a selective herbicide, meaning that it will kill most broadleaf weeds but not grass, so it is safe to use on your lawn.\nHow do you apply concentrates?\nUse your outside hose to fill the sprayer up to the 1-gallon mark. Pour in a full 5 oz. bottle of Dandelion Doom concentrate into the reusable pouch and attach the wand sprayer. Firmly reattach the lid of the reusable pouch and mix slowly. Apply to broadleaf weeds within your lawn. Do not spray on rocks, concrete or other hard surfaces.\nHow long do the concentrates last?\nThe concentrates have a shelf life of approximately two years. After the initial mixing, you will want to make sure it is mixed well again if it sits for 30, or more, days.\nWhat's the coverage area for the concentrates?\nOur herbicide concentrates can cover approximately 224 sq. ft. and should be applied to your existing weeds. The coverage area is the total square footage of the weeds themselves, not necessarily the entire lawn.\nWhat\u2019s in it and how does it work?\nThe active ingredient, iron, is toxic to broadleaf weeds in high doses. Because grass has a much higher iron tolerance, it doesn't get damaged. The areas where you spray may turn a dark green/gray/black color after spraying, but this doesn\u2019t mean the grass will die.\nDoes Dandelion Doom work on anything else?\nGood news! The iron in Dandelion Doom also suppresses lawn diseases such as Dollar Spot, rust, snow mold, and more."
