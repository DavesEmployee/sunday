    "faq": "How do annual plans work?\nSunday\u2019s Tick Protection Plan is a comprehensive solution for tick control and reduction. One simple shipment contains a year\u2019s worth of products to repel and control ticks for immediate relief. You\u2019ll also get a personalized checklist with optimal application timing and key prevention actions to effectively reduce tick activity based on your region. When combined, this holistic approach can effectively reduce tick presence in your yard.\nHow should I apply my products?\nFollow your custom My Plan Checklist (located on your account page) for Nix Ticks application dates, product instructions, and seasonal pest prevention actions.\nFor best results, spray in an up-and-down motion to cover your protected lawn area, trees, mulch, and bushes until all foliage is just fully wet, but not soaked.\nHow do I use it alongside a Sunday lawn plan?\nIdeally, apply all lawn products before pest control products and allow for drying time in between applications. Always allow pest control to dry for a few hours before doing anything else to the lawn to avoid interfering with the product\u2019s ability to repel properly.\nHow long will it last?\nOur Tick Protection Plan offers you a full year of tick control and protection - meaning you\u2019ll be covered for peak tick activity from early spring to late fall.\nNix Ticks applications will be effective for up to 2-4 weeks depending on your climate (effective longer in dry climates).\nWhat products are in my plan?\nNix Ticks is a 25(b) minimum risk pesticide made from cedarwood oil (17%) to repel and kill ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes on contact. 1 bottle covers about 5,000 sq. ft.\nWhat safety precautions should I follow?\nDo not apply on flowering plants or near areas where bees and other pollinators are active.\nWhat states are restricted?\nDC, ID, IN, MD, ME, MS, MT"
