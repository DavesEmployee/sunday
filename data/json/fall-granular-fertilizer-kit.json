    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow is Sunday granular fertilizer different from traditional fertilizers?\nMost granular fertilizers stop at nutrition. Sunday granulated are the complete care package. Our formulas combine slow-release nutrients with soil-building ingredients and specialized formulations (with surfactant or kelp) that help your lawn stay resilient during summer heatwaves.\nWhen should I fertilize my lawn in the fall?\nWe recommend applying your fall nutrients while you are still seeing active growth in your lawn. This varies by climate, but for cool and transitional regions, complete your applications by October. For warm-season grasses, it may be earlier.\nHow should I use the fertilizer bags in my kit if my lawn is less than 4,000 sq. ft.?\nCore Seagreen and Core Endurance cover up to 4,000 sq. ft.\n500-1,000 sq. ft.: Apply 1/4 of a bag (4 uses)\n1,000-2,000 sq. ft.: Apply 1/2 of a bag (2 uses)\n2,000-3,000 sq. ft.: Apply 3/4 of a bag\n3,000-4,000 sq. ft.: Apply full bag\nSave any remaining fertilizer for next spring.\nHow to apply alongside other Sunday products\nSunday fertilizers are made to work together! For granular fertilizers, wait 4-6 weeks before applying more fertilizer or switching to a different Sunday fertilizer. For all other lawn products, let the fertilizer dry on the lawn first, then apply other products.\nWhen is it safe for people and pets to go on my lawn after applying?\nOur ingredients break down quickly and don\u2019t persist in the environment. Once the product is watered in and your lawn dries, it\u2019s safe for people and pets to resume activities!\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis kit is approved for use in all states."
