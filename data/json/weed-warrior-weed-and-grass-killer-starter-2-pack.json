    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow does weed and grass killer work?\nWeed Warrior is a powerful herbicidal soap made from fatty acids, it eats away at the waxy coating that protects most green leafy growth from the elements.\nConcentrates have a shelf life of ~2 years. After the initial mixing, mix well again if it sits for 30+ days.\nCan I use weed and grass killer on my lawn?\nWeed Warrior is non-selective, meaning it will kill any unwanted vegetation - weeds and grass. We recommend using it in gardens, sidewalks, mulch and other hardscapes rather than within your lawn.\nIf you use Weed Warrior within your lawn, repair bare patches with Sunday grass seed or Bare Repair.\nHow to use Weed Warrior with other Sunday products?\nYou can apply weed killer, like Weed Warrior, before or after lawn fertilizer.\nAllow weed control products to dry completely before applying any other Sunday liquid products or watering your lawn\u2013the longer the plant absorbs the weed control, the more effective the application.\nWhen will I see results?\nFully drenched weeds will dry up in as little as 20 minutes or up to 24 hours, depending on the size and maturity of the plant you are spraying.\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all states."
