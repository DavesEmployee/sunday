    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow does this lawn-safe weed killer work?\nGrass and weeds absorb iron differently. Weeds quickly take in too much iron, which becomes toxic and kills them. Grass absorbs iron more slowly and can tolerate higher amounts.\nWhat weeds does Dandelion Doom control?\nDandelion Doom is effective on broadleaf weeds like black medic*, broadleaf plantain, bull thistle, Canada thistle*, common chickweed*, creeping buttercup, creeping charlie/ground ivy*, dandelion, dovefoot geranium*, English daisy*, false dandelion, healall*, moss, liverworts*, algae* and lichens*, narrow-leaved plantain*, oxalis, Persian Speedwell, prostrate knotweed*, shepherd\u2019s-purse*, silverweed cinquefoil*, slender speedwell*, white clover, wild chamomile*.\nIt can also control or suppress diseases such as but not limited to*: Dollar Spot, Rust or Snow Mold.\n*Not approved for this use in California. Please see CA label for all approved use.\nDo I need the Dandelion Doom Starter Pack to use this product?\nYes, these are refill concentrates only. You'll need the sprayer and pouch that come with the Dandelion Doom Starter Pack or Starter 2-Pack to apply this product.\nHow many applications will I get from this 2-pack?\nEach bottle treats up to 224 sq. ft. of lawn area, so the 2-pack provides enough concentrate for two separate applications at this coverage, or one application over a larger 448 sq. ft. area.\nHow to use Dandelion Doom with other Sunday products?\nYou can apply Dandelion Doom before or after lawn fertilizer. Allow weed control products to dry completely before applying other liquid products or watering your lawn\u2013the longer the weed control absorbs, the more effective the application.\nDoes Dandelion Doom stain?\nIt can cause staining due to high iron formula. Avoid using on sidewalks or hard surfaces. If you spill, immediately rinse the area. For best results, mix over lawn or landscape\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all states."
