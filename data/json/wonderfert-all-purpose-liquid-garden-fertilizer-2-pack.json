    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nWhy choose liquid fertilizer for plants?\nLiquid fertilizer formulas, like WondertFert All-Purpose, allow for rapid and sustained uptake of nitrogen, and rapid, visible results of leafy growth, flowering, and fruiting.\nHow does slow-release fertilizer work?\nSlow-release fertilizer refers to slow-release nitrogen. It provides sustained uptake of nitrogen to plants over some time which helps support leafy growth, flowering, and fruiting for longer.\nWhen should I apply all-purpose fertilizer to my garden?\nApply to flowers and perennials from spring to summer, trees and shrubs in spring, vegetables during the growing season, and indoor plants from spring through fall. Avoid fertilizing woody and perennial plants in the fall.\nHow to use with other Sunday products?\nIf using other Sunday products, let liquid fertilizers dry completely before applying anything else to your garden. For best results, use our liquid garden fertilizer in combination with Sunday\u2019s dry organic fertilizer, Soil Boost, and weed control. This will help you fertilize plants properly, reduce weeds, and introduce nutrients back to your soil."
