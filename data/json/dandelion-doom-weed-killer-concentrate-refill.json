    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow does this lawn-safe weed killer work?\nGrass and weeds absorb iron differently. Weeds quickly take in too much iron, which becomes toxic and kills them. Grass absorbs iron more slowly and can tolerate higher amounts.\nWhat weeds does Dandelion Doom control?\nEffective against broadleaf weeds like black medic, plantain, thistle, chickweed, creeping buttercup, creeping charlie, dandelion, geranium sp., English daisy, false dandelion, healall, oxalis, speedwell sp/, knotweed, shepherd\u2019s-purse, silverweed cinquefoil, white clover, wild chamomile, as well as moss, liverworts, algae and lichens.\nIt can also control or suppress lawn diseases: dollar spot, rust and/or snow mold.\nDo I need the Dandelion Doom Starter Pack to use this product?\nYes, this is a refill concentrate only. You'll need the sprayer and pouch that come with the Dandelion Doom Starter Pack or Starter 2-Pack to apply this product.\nHow to use Dandelion Doom with other Sunday products?\nYou can apply Dandelion Doom before or after lawn fertilizer. Allow weed control products to dry completely before applying other liquid products or watering your lawn\u2013the longer the weed control absorbs, the more effective the application.\nDoes Dandelion Doom stain?\nYes, it can cause staining due to high iron content. Avoid using on sidewalks or hard surfaces. If you accidentally spill, immediately spray and dilute the area. For best results, mix over grassy or landscaped areas.\nAre there any US states where this is not approved for use?\nThis product is approved for use in all states."
