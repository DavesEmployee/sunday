    "faq": "How soon will I see results with Heat Defense Granular?\nWith good moisture, you should notice a greener, thicker lawn in about 1 to 2 weeks.\nIs Heat Defense Granular safe for all grasses?\nSure is. While designed with the arid West in mind, this product can be used on any lawn or grass type.\nWhen should I apply Heat Defense Granular?\nLate spring is prime time, right before summer heat. You can also use it ahead of a forecasted dry spell.\nWill Heat Defense Granular let me water less?\nNo. It improves water movement and soil moisture behavior but does not reduce irrigation needs. To reduce watering needs, add Sunday\u2019s Drought Defense into your normal routine. You can use it alongside any Sunday lawn fertilizer, liquid or dry."
