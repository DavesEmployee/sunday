    "faq": "How do annual plans work?\nSunday\u2019s Total Home Protection Plan is a holistic pest management solution for indoor pest control and reduction, and it includes both barrier and spot treatments. Your plan arrives in one simple shipment that renews annually. You\u2019ll also get a personalized checklist with optimal application timing and seasonal prevention actions designed for your home. When combined, this comprehensive approach can effectively reduce indoor and overwintering pest presence around and inside your home.\nHow should I apply my products?\nFollow your custom My Plan Checklist (located on your account page) for Bug Doom application dates, product instructions, and seasonal pest prevention actions.\nApplications should be based on the type of pests you are treating.
