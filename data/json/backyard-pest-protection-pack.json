    "faq": "How often should I apply it?\nApply Mosquito Deleto and Nix Ticks every 14 days in regions with higher precipitation, or every 28 days in drier areas. Reapply after heavy rainfall, and the day before outdoor events to ensure coverage.\nApply Ant Adios every 2 to 4 weeks as bait is consumed. You may need to reapply after rainfall or if bait gets wet.\nShould I treat my entire lawn?\nRather than covering the entire lawn, designate a \u201cprotected zone\u201d in the area where you spend the most time. Spray this zone every 14\u201328 days.\nHow do I apply it?\nIt's best to apply Ant Adios first and let it get to work for one to two weeks before applying Mosquito Deleto and Nix Ticks. If you use them at the same time, avoid spraying where you laid the ant bait.\nScatter Ant Adios on mounds, in a barrier around the home structure, across the lawn, and on soil around or near plants in need. Avoid applying over flowering plants when pollinators are present!\nSpray Mosquito Deleto and Nix Ticks in an up-and-down motion, working quickly to cover your protected lawn area, trees, mulch, and bushes until all foliage is fully wet.\nShould I use these products before or after Sunday nutrients?\nIt\u2019s best to apply Ant Adios at least one to two weeks before applying Sunday nutrients, so the bait doesn\u2019t get wet; alternatively, you can wait 24 hours after hosing on nutrients and then apply Ant Adios.\nFor Mosquito Deleto and Nix Ticks, you can apply before or after your Sunday nutrients; just wait 24 hours between applications to avoid contaminating or diluting either formula.\nAre there any US states or territories where Mosquito Deleto and Ant Adios are not approved for use?\nMosquito Deleto is not yet approved for use in the following states and territories: DC, ID, IN, MD, ME, MS, MT.\nAnt Adios is approved for use in all states."
