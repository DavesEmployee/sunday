    "faq": "Helpful Tips from Lawn Advisors:\nHow does fertilization of trees promote healthy growth?\nFertilization of trees promotes healthy growth by supplying essential nutrients that strengthen roots, improve overall health, and enhance foliage.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between liquid tree fertilizer and tree fertilizer spikes?\nTree fertilizer spikes are solid, slow-release fertilizers that are driven into the soil around a tree, providing nutrients over an extended period. Liquid tree fertilizers, like WonderFert Tree & Shrub, are applied directly to the soil allowing for quicker absorption and more precise control of nutrient delivery. While both are effective, liquid fertilizers offer faster results and easier application for time-efficient tree nourishment.\nCan this liquid fertilizer be used on all types of trees and shrubs?\nIt's suitable for most types, including evergreen, deciduous and flowering trees. However, it\u2019s not labeled for palm trees, so we recommend finding a palm-specific fertilizer.\nIs this a good fertilizer for fruit trees?\nIt's suitable for a range of trees, including fruit-bearing ones, and can aid in kick-starting growth and leafy growth for an extended period. The enhanced leafy growth helps support increased energy and sugar production, which are crucial for abundant fruiting. Pro tip: always ensure that the specific nutritional needs of your fruit trees align with the fertilizer's formula.\nHow to use with other Sunday products\nIf using other Sunday products, let liquid fertilizers dry completely before applying anything else to your garden. For best results, use our liquid garden fertilizer in combination with Sunday\u2019s dry organic fertilizer, Soil Boost and weed control. This will help you fertilize plants properly, reduce weeds, and introduce nutrients back to your soil."
