    "faq": "What\u2019s in it?\nSunday\u2019s new organic dry garden nutrients are intended for every garden need and for customized use.\nSunday\u2019s Flower & Rose Garden Nutrients is ideal for flower pots & beds, both new and established. Its key nutrients\u2014nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus\u2014are sourced from dried poultry litter, fish bone meal, blood meal, potassium sulfate, sulfate of potash-magnesia, kelp meal, and gypsum.\nHow does it work?\nThe formulation provides a targeted blend of organic and natural ingredients to boost blooms for flowers and roses. Our Flower & Rose Garden Nutrients offers a lower nitrogen profile to prevent excess leafy growth (an energy deterrent of flower production) - allowing your roses and blooms to take center stage. Plus, ingredients like feather meal and poultry litter are rich in carbon and help build soil organic matter over time for bountiful blooms year after year.\nWhen is the best time to apply nutrients?\nFlowers and perennial plants: Spring to summer (as long as plants aren\u2019t heat or drought-stressed)\nTrees and shrubs: Spring\nDon\u2019t fertilize woody and perennial plants in the fall; sometimes nitrogen applications to gardens in the fall can prevent dormancy and lead to plant stress and damage.\nHow do I use it?\nGarden beds can be fertilized every 4-6 weeks during the growing season. Potted plants can be fertilized every 6 weeks during the growing season.\nFor new containers or flower pots, use 2 tbsp/gal or 1 cup/ft3 of soil.\nFor established containers/pots, use 1 tbsp for every 4\u201d of pot diameter.\nFor outdoor plants like gardens, bulbs, or flower beds, use 2 cups per 25 square feet, or the entire bag for 50 square feet.\nShould I treat my entire garden?\nWe recommend incorporating it into the soil where plantings will occur to use the product in a more targeted way\u2014which saves you money and product for future use.\nHow do I use this alongside my Sunday lawn plan or fertilizer?\nAs long as you\u2019re not applying products in the same area, you can apply products at the same time.\nCan I use this if I\u2019m already using another garden fertilizer product?\nIf you want to use another fertilizer or switch to using Sunday Garden Nutrients, we recommend waiting at least 4-6 weeks between applications to avoid over-fertilization and wasteful applications.\nWhat's the difference between Sunday\u2019s dry garden nutrients and liquid garden fertilizer?\nSunday\u2019s dry garden nutrients need to be incorporated into the soil before they can break down and be taken up by plants, making it especially well-suited for use before or at planting. It also delivers greater quantities of secondary nutrients - like phosphorus to help flower and fruit production. As an added bonus, it helps build organic matter over time as it contains carbon-rich materials.\nOur liquid garden fertilizer, WonderFert, can be applied any time of the season, offers a slightly more uniform application of nutrients and is quickly absorbed by the plant through foliar application. It also doesn\u2019t require being incorporated into the soil. The downfall - the formula can separate if not shaken before use.\nDo I need to wait to re-enter the space?\nPets and humans can use areas as soon as products are incorporated into the soil. Helpful Tip: pets might be attracted to the product - you can fence areas off to avoid sniffing or rolling.\nAre there any US states or territories where it\u2019s not approved for use?\nOR"
