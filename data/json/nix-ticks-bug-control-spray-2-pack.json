    "faq": "When should I see results?\nThis biodegradable product is an effective repellent for common tick populations, with best results after continued application. If you\u2019ve only applied one treatment, we suggest an extra bumper application before continuing the best practices listed on the package.\nHow often should I apply it?\nApply twice within 7 days to kick start pest reduction, then every 30 days after that for best results.\nHow many square feet does one bottle cover?\nUp to 5,000 sq. ft.\nHow do I apply it?\nSpray in an up and down motion, working quickly to cover your protected lawn area, trees, mulch, and bushes until all foliage is just fully wet.\nShould I use Nix Ticks before or after Sunday nutrients?\nYou can apply either one first\u2014the order is totally up to you! Regardless, you\u2019ll want to wait 24 hours between those applications to avoid washing out or diluting either formula.\nAre there any US states or territories where Nix Ticks is not approved for use?\nNix Ticks is not yet approved for use in the following states and territories: AS, DC, GU, ID, IN, MD, ME, MP, MS, MT, PR, SD, VI."
